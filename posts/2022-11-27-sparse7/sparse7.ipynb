        "Right. Let's try again. What if instead of doing all those scatters we instead, idk, just store two vectors and sort. Because at this point I will try fucking anything. What if we just list out the column index and row index as we find them (aka build the sparse matrix in COO^[COO stands for _coordinate list_ and it's the least space-efficient of our options. It directly stores 3 length `n` vectors `(row, col, value)`. It's great for specifying matrices and it's pretty easy to convert from this format to any of the others.] format. The `jax.experimental.sparse` module has support for (blocked) COO objects but doesn't implement this transformation. `scipy.sparse` has a fast conversion routine so I'm going to use it. In the interest of being 100% JAX, I tried a version with `jnp.lexsort[index[1][jnp.lexsort((index[1], index[0]))]`], which basically does the same thing but it's a lot slower.\n"
