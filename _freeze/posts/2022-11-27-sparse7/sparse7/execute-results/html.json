There's been a bit of a pause, mostly because I realised that I didn't know how to implement the sparse Cholesky factorisation in a JAX-traceable way. But now the time has come. It is time for me to get on top of JAX's weird control-flow constructs.\n\nAnd, along the way, I'm going to re-do the sparse Cholesky factorisation to make it, well, better.\n\nIn order to temper expectations, I will tell you that this post does not do the numerical factorisation, only the symbolic one. Why? Well I wrote most of it on a long-haul flight and I didn't get to the numerical part. And this was long enough. So hold your breaths for Part 7b, which will come as soon as I write it.\n\nYou can consider this a _much_ better re-do of [Part 2](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-23-getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices/getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices.html). This is no longer my first python coding exercise in a decade, so hopefully the code is better. And I'm definitely trying a lot harder to think about the limitations of JAX.\n\nBefore I start, I should probably say why I'm doing this. JAX is a truly magical thing that will compute gradients and every thing else just by clever processing of the Jacobian-vector product code. Unfortunately, this is only possible if the Jacobian-vector product code is JAX traceable and this code is structurally extremely similar^[If you're wondering about the break between sparse matrix posts, I realised this pretty much immediately and just didn't want to deal with it!] to the code for the sparse Cholesky factorisation.\n\nI am doing this in the hope of (eventually getting to) autodiff. But that won't be this blog post. This blog post is complicated enough.\n\n## Control flow of the damned\n\nThe first an most important rule of programming with JAX is that loops will break your heart. I mean, whatever, I guess they're fine. But there's a problem. Imagine the following function\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef f(x: jax.Array, n: Int) -> jax.Array:\n  out = jnp.zeros_like(x)\n  for j in range(n):\n    out = out + x\n  return out\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is, basically, the worst implementation of multiplication by an integer that you can possibly imagine. This code will run fine in Python, but if you try to JIT compile it, JAX is gonna get _angry_. It will produce the machine code equivalent of \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef f_n(x):\n  out = x\n  out = out + x\n  out = out + x\n  // do this n times\n  return out\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are two bad things happening here. First, note that the \"compiled\" code depends on `n` and will have to be compiled anew each time `n` changes. Secondly, the loop has been replaced by `n` copies of the loop body. This is called _loop unrolling_ and, when used judiciously by a clever compiler, is a great way to speed up code. When done completely for _every_ loop this is a nightmare and the corresponding code will take a geological amount of time to compile.\n\nA similar thing^[If a person who actually knows how the JAX autodiff works happens across this blog, I'm so sorry.] happens when you need to run autodiff on `f(x,n)`. For each `n` an expression graph is constructed that contains the unrolled for loop. This suggests that autodiff might also end up being quite slow (or, more problematically, more memory-hungry).\n\nSo the first rule of JAX is to avoid for loops. But if you can't do that, there are three built-in loop structures that play nicely with JIT compilation and sometimes^[omg you guys. So many details] differentiation. These three constructs are\n\n1. A while loop `jax.lax.while(cond_func, body_func, init)`\n2. An accumulator `jax.lax.scan(body_func, init, xs)`\n3. A for loop `jax.lax.fori_loop(lower, upper, body_fun, init)`\n\nOf those three, the first and third work mostly as you'd expect, while the second is a bit more hairy. The `while` function is roughly equivalent to \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n`\ndef jax_lax_while_loop(cond_func, body_func, init):\n  x  = init\n  while cond_func(x):\n    x = body_func(x)\n  return x\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo basically it's just a while loop. The thing that's important is that it compiles down to a single XLA operation^[These are referred to as HLOs (Higher-level operations)] instead of some unrolled mess. \n\nOne thing that is important to realise is that while loops are only forwards-mode differentiable, which means that it is _very_ expensive^[Instead of doing one pass of reverse-mode, you would need to do $d$ passes of forwards mode to get the gradient with respect to a d-dimensional parameter.] to compute gradients. The reason for this is that we simply do not know how long that loop actually is and so it's impossible to build a fixed-size expression graph.\n\nThe `jax.lax.scan` function is probably the one that people will be least familiar with. That said, it's also the one that is roughly \"how a for loop should work\". The concept that's important here is a for-loop with _carry over_. Carry over is information that changes from one step of the loop to the next. This is what separates us from a `map` statement, which would apply the same function independently to each element of a list.\n\nThe scan function looks like \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef jax_lax_scan(body_func, init, xs):\n  len_x0 = len(x0)\n  if not all(len(x) == len_x0 for x in xs):\n    raise ValueError(\"All x must have the same length!!\")\n  carry = init\n  ys = []\n  for x in xs:\n    carry, y = body_func(carry, x)\n    ys.append(y)\n  \n  return carry, np.stack(ys)\n```\n:::\n\n\nA critically important limitation to `jax.lax.scan` is that  is that every `x` in `xs` must have the same shape! This mean, for example, that \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nxs = [[1], [2,3], [4], 5,6,7]\n```\n:::\n\n\nis not a valid argument. Like all limitations in JAX, this serves to make the code transformable into efficiently compiled code across various different processors.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to use `jax.lax.scan` on my example from before I would get\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom jax import lax\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\n\ndef f(x, n):\n  init = jnp.zeros_like(x)\n  xs = jnp.repeat(x, n)\n  def body_func(carry, y):\n    val = carry + y\n    return (val, val)\n  \n  final, journey = lax.scan(body_func, init, xs)\n  return (final, journey)\n\nfinal, journey = f(1.2, 7)\nprint(final)\nprint(journey)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n8.4\n[1.2       2.4       3.6000001 4.8       6.        7.2       8.4      ]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis translation is a bit awkward compared to the for loop but it's the sort of thing that you get used to.\n\nThis function can be differentiated^[Unlike `jax.lax.while`, which is only forwards differentiable, `jax.lax.scan` is fully differentiable.] and compiled. To differentiate it, I need a version that returns a scalar, which is easy enough to do with a lambda.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom jax import jit, grad\n\nf2 = lambda x, n: f(x,n)[0]\nf2_grad = grad(f2, argnums = 0)\n\nprint(f2_grad(1.2, 7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n7.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `argnums` option tells JAX that we are only differentiating wrt the first argument.\n\nJIT compilation is a tiny bit more delicate. If we try the natural thing, we are going to get an error.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nf_jit_bad = jit(f)\nbad = f_jit_bad(1.2, 7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nConcretizationTypeError: Abstract tracer value encountered where concrete value is expected: Traced<ShapedArray(int32[], weak_type=True)>with<DynamicJaxprTrace(level=0/1)>\nWhen jit-compiling jnp.repeat, the total number of repeats must be static. To fix this, either specify a static value for `repeats`, or pass a static value to `total_repeat_length`.\nThe error occurred while tracing the function f at /var/folders/08/4p5p665j4d966tr7nvr0v24c0000gn/T/ipykernel_22750/3851190413.py:4 for jit. This concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the value of the argument 'n'.\n\nSee https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/errors.html#jax.errors.ConcretizationTypeError\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn order to compile a function, JAX needs to know how big everything is. And right now it does not know what `n` is. This shows itself through the `ConcretizationTypeError`, which basically says that as JAX was looking through your code it found something it can't manipulate. In this case, it was in the `jnp.repeat` function.\n\nWe can fix this problem by declaring this parameter `static`.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nf_jit = jit(f, static_argnums=(1,))\nprint(f_jit(1.2,7)[0])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n8.4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n A static parameter is a parameter value that is known at compile time. If we define `n` to be static, then the first time you call `f_jit(x, 7)` it will compile and then it will reuse the compiled code for any other value of `x`. If we then call `f_jit(x, 9)`, the code will _compile again_. \n\n To see this, we can make use of a JAX oddity: if a function prints something^[In general, if the function has state.], then it will only be printed upon compilation and never again. This means that we can't do _debug by print_. But on the upside, it's easy to check, when things are compiling.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef f2(x, n):\n  print(f\"compiling: n = {n}\")\n  return f(x,n)[0]\n\nf2_jit = jit(f2, static_argnums=(1,))\nprint(f2_jit(1.2,7))\nprint(f2_jit(1.8,7))\nprint(f2_jit(1.2,9))\nprint(f2_jit(1.8,7))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ncompiling: n = 7\n8.4\n12.6\ncompiling: n = 9\n10.799999\n12.6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is a perfectly ok solution as long as the static parameters don't change very often. In our context, this is going to have to do with the sparsity pattern.\n\nFinally, we can talk about `jax.lax.fori_loop`, the in-built for loop. This is basically a convenience wrapper for `jax.lax.scan` (when `lower` and `upper` are static) or `jax.lax.while` (when they are not). The Python pseudocode is \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef jax_lax_fori_loop(lower, upper, body_func, init):\n  out = init\n  for i in range(lower, upper):\n    out = body_func(i, out)\n  return out\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo close out this bit where I repeat the docs, there is also a traceable if/else: `jax.lax.cond` which has the pseudocode\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef jax_lax_cond(pred, true_fun, false_fun, val):\n  if pred:\n    return true_fun(val)\n  else:\n    return false_fun(val)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Building a JAX-traceable symbolic sparse Choleksy factorisation\n\nIn order to build a JAX-traceable sparse Cholesky factorisation $A = LL^T$, we are going to need to build up a few moving parts.\n\n1. Build the elimination tree of $A$ and find the number of non-zeros in each column of $L$\n\n2. Build the _symbolic factorisation_^[This is the version of the symbolic factorisation that is most appropriate for us, as we will be doing a lot of Cholesky factorisations with the same sparsity structure. If we rearrange the algorithm to the up-looking Cholesky decomposition, we only need the column counts and this is also called the symbolic factorisation. This is, incidentally, how Eigen's sparse Cholesky works.] of $L$ (aka the location of the non-zeros of $L$)\n\n3. Do the actual numerical decomposition.\n\nIn the [previous post](https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-23-getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices/getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices.html) we did not explicitly form the elimination tree. Instead, I used dynamic memory allocation. This time I'm being more mature.\n\n### Building the expression graph\n\nThe elimination tree^[Actually it's a forest] $\\mathcal{T}_A$ is a (forest of) rooted tree(s) that compactly represent the non-zero pattern of the Cholesky factor $L$. In particular, the elimination tree has the property that, for any $k > j$ , $L_{kj} \\neq 0$ if and only if there is a path from $j$ to $k$ in the tree. Or, in the language of trees, $L_{kj} \\neq 0$ if and only if $j$ is a descendant of $k$ in the tree $\\mathcal{T}_A$.\n\nWe can describe^[Because we are talking about a tree, each child node has at most one parent. If it doesn't have a parent it's the root of the tree. I remember a lecturer saying that it should be called \"father and son\" or \"mother and daughter\" because every child has 2 parents but only one mother or one father. The 2000s were a wild time.] $\\mathcal{T}_A$ by listing the parent of each node. The parent node of $j$ in the tree is the smallest $i > j$ with $L_{ij} \\neq 0$.\n\nWe can turn this into an algorithm. An efficient version, which is described in Tim Davies book takes about $\\mathcal{O(\\text{nnz}(A))}$ operations. But I'm going to program up a slower one that takes $\\mathcal{O(\\text{nnz}(L))}$ operations, but has the added benefit^[These can also be computed in approximately $\\mathcal{O(\\text{nnz}(A))}$ time, which is much faster. But the algorithm is, frankly, pretty tricky and I'm not in the mood to program it up. This difference would be quite important if I wasn't storing the full symbolic factorisation and was instead computing it every time, but in my context it is less clear that this is worth the effort.] of giving me the column counts for free.\n\nTo do this, we are going to walk the tree and dynamically add up the column counts as we go. \n\nTo start off, let's do this in standard python so that we can see what the algorithm look like. The key concept is that if we write $\\mathcal{T}_{j-1}$ as the elimination tree encoding the structure of^[Python notation! This is rows/cols 0 to `j-1`] `L[:j, :j]`, then we can ask about how this tree connects with node `j`.\n\nA theorem gives a very simple answer to this.\n\n::: {#thm-tree}\nIf $j > i$, then $A_{j,i} \\neq 0$ implies that $i$ is a descendant of $j$ in $\\mathcal{T}_A$. In particular, that means that there is a directed path in $\\mathcal{T}_A$ from $i$ to $j$.\n:::\n\nThis tells us that the connection between $\\mathcal{T}_{j-1}$ and node $j$ is that for each non-zero elements $i$ of the $j$th row of $A$, we can walk $\\mathcal{T} must have a path in $\\mathcal{T}_{j-1}$ from $i$ and we will eventually get to a node that has no parent in $\\{0,\\ldots, j-1\\}$. Because there _must_ be a path from $i$ to $j$ in $T_j$, it means that the parent of this terminal node must be $j$.\n\nAs with everything Cholesky related, this works because the algorithm proceeds from left to right, which in this case means that the node label associated with _any_ descendant of $j$ is always less than $j$.\n\nThe algorithm is then a fairly run-of-the-mill^[Python, it turns out, does not have a `do while` construct because, apparently, everything is empty and life is meaningless.] tree traversal, where we keep track of where we have been so we don't double count our columns.\n\nProbably the most important thing here is that I am using the _full_ sparse matrix rather than just its lower triangle. This is, basically, convenience. I need access to the left half of the $j$th row of $A$, which is conveniently the same as the top half of the $j$th column. And sometimes you just don't want to be dicking around with swapping between row- and column-based representations.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef etree_base(A_indices, A_indptr):\n  n = len(A_indptr) - 1\n  parent = [-1] * n\n  mark = [-1] * n\n  col_count = [1] * n\n  for j in range(n):\n    mark[j] = j\n    for indptr in range(A_indptr[j], A_indptr[j+1]):\n      node = A_indices[indptr]\n      while node < j and mark[node] != j:\n        if parent[node] == -1:\n          parent[node] = j\n        mark[node] = j\n        col_count[node] += 1\n        node = parent[node]\n  return (parent, col_count)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo convince ourselves this works, let's run an example and compare the column counts we get to our previous method.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Some boilerplate from previous editions.\"}\nfrom scipy import sparse\nimport scipy as sp\n    \n\ndef make_matrix(n):\n  one_d = sparse.diags([[-1.]*(n-2), [2.]*n, [-1.]*(n-2)], [-2,0,2])\n  A = (sparse.kronsum(one_d, one_d) + sparse.eye(n*n))\n  A_csc = A.tocsc()\n  A_csc.eliminate_zeros()\n  A_lower = sparse.tril(A_csc, format = \"csc\")\n  A_index = A_lower.indices\n  A_indptr = A_lower.indptr\n  A_x = A_lower.data\n  return (A_index, A_indptr, A_x, A_csc)\n\ndef _symbolic_factor(A_indices, A_indptr):\n  # Assumes A_indices and A_indptr index the lower triangle of $A$ ONLY.\n  n = len(A_indptr) - 1\n  L_sym = [np.array([], dtype=int) for j in range(n)]\n  children = [np.array([], dtype=int) for j in range(n)]\n  \n  for j in range(n):\n    L_sym[j] = A_indices[A_indptr[j]:A_indptr[j + 1]]\n    for child in children[j]:\n      tmp = L_sym[child][L_sym[child] > j]\n      L_sym[j] = np.unique(np.append(L_sym[j], tmp))\n    if len(L_sym[j]) > 1:\n      p = L_sym[j][1]\n      children[p] = np.append(children[p], j)\n        \n  L_indptr = np.zeros(n+1, dtype=int)\n  L_indptr[1:] = np.cumsum([len(x) for x in L_sym])\n  L_indices = np.concatenate(L_sym)\n  \n  return L_indices, L_indptr\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# A_indices/A_indptr are the lower triangle, A is the entire matrix\nA_indices, A_indptr, A_x, A = make_matrix(37)\nparent, col_count = etree_base(A.indices, A.indptr)\nL_indices, L_indptr = _symbolic_factor(A_indices, A_indptr)\n\ntrue_parent = L_indices[L_indptr[:-2] + 1]\ntrue_parent[np.where(np.diff(L_indptr[:-1]) == 1)] = -1\nprint(all(x == y for (x,y) in zip(parent[:-1], true_parent)))\n\ntrue_col_count  = np.diff(L_indptr)\nprint(all(true_col_count == col_count))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExcellent.

For the first three examples, the computation time is dominated by the compilation time, but we see when the matrix has a million unknowns the compilation time is negligible. At this scale it would probably be worth using the fancy algorithm. That said, it is probably not worth sweating a three second that is only done once when your problem is that big! \n\n### The non-zero pattern of $L$\n\nNow that we know how many non-zeros there are, it's time to populate them. Last time, I used some dynamic memory allocation to make this work, but JAX is certainly not going to allow me to do that. So instead I'm going to have to do the worst thing possible: think.\n\nThe way that we went about it last time was, to be honest, a bit arse-backwards. The main reason for this is that I did not have access to the elimination tree. But now we do, we can actually use it.\n\nThe trick is to slightly rearrange^[We will still use the left-looking algorithm for the numerical computation. The two algorithms are equivalent in exact arithmetic and, in particular, have identical sparsity structures.] the order of operations to get something that is more convenient for working out the structure. \n\nRecall from last time that we used the _left-looking_ Cholesky factorisation, which can be written in the dense case as \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef dense_left_cholesky(A):\n  n = A.shape[0]\n  L = np.zeros_like(A)\n  for j in range(n):\n    L[j,j] = np.sqrt(A[j,j] - np.inner(L[j, :j], L[j, :j]))\n    L[(j+1):, j] = (A[(j+1):, j] - L[(j+1):, :j] @ L[j, :j].transpose()) / L[j,j]\n  return L\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is not the only way to organise those operations. An alternative is the _up-looking_ Cholesky factorisation, which can be implemented in the dense case as\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef dense_up_cholesky(A):\n  n = A.shape[0]\n  L = np.zeros_like(A)\n  L[0,0] = np.sqrt(A[0,0])\n  for i in range(1,n):\n    #if i > 0:\n    L[i, :i] = (np.linalg.solve(L[:i, :i], A[:i,i])).transpose()\n    L[i, i] = np.sqrt(A[i,i] - np.inner(L[i, :i], L[i, :i]))\n  return L\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is quite a different looking beast! It scans row by row rather than column by column. And while the left-looking algorithm is based on matrix-vector multiplies, the up-looking algorithm is based on triangular solves. So maybe we should pause for a moment to check that these are the same algorithm!\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nA = np.random.rand(15, 15)\nA = A + A.transpose()\nA = A.transpose() @ A + 1*np.eye(15)\n\nL_left = dense_left_cholesky(A)\nL_up = dense_up_cholesky(A)\n\nprint(round(sum(sum(abs((L_left - L_up)[:])))),2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n0 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey are the same!!\n\nThe reason for considering the up-looking algorithm is that it gives a slightly nicer description of the non-zeros of row `i`, which will let us find the location of the non-zeros in the whole matrix. In particular, the non-zeros to the left of the diagonal on row `i` correspond to the non-zero indices of the solution to  the lower triangular linear system^[I'm mixing 1-based indexing in the maths with 0-based in the code because I think we need more chaos in our lives.] \n$$\nL_{1:(i-1),1:(i-1)} x^{(i)} = A_{1:i-1, i}.\n$$\nBecause $A$ is sparse, this is a system of $\\operatorname{nnz}(A_{1:i-1,i})$ linear equations, rather than $(i-1)$ equations that we would have in the dense case. That means that the sparsity pattern of $x^{(i)}$ will be the union of the sparsity patterns of the columns of $L_{1:(i-1),1:(i-1)}$  that correspond to the non-zero entries of $A_{1:i-1, i}$.\n\nThis means two things. Firstly, if $A_{ji}\\neq 0$, then $x^{(i)}_j \\neq 0$. Secondly, if $x^{(i)}_j \\neq 0 $ _and_ $L_{kj}\\neq 0$, then $x_k \\neq 0$. These two facts give us a way of finding the non-zero set of $x^{(i)}$ if we remember just one more fact: a definition of the elimination tree is that $L_{kj} \\neq 0$ if $j$ is a descendant of $k$ in the elimination tree.\n\nThis reduces the problem of finding the non-zero elements of $x^{(i)}$ to the problem of finding all of the descendants of $\\{j: A_{ji} \\neq 0\\}$ in the subtree $\\mathcal{T}_{i-1}$. And if there is one thing that people who are ok at programming are _excellent_ at it is walking down a damn tree.\n\nSo let's do that. Well, I've already done it. In fact, that was how I found the column counts in the first place! With this interpretation, the outer loop is taking us across the rows. And once I am in row `j`^[Yes. I know. I'm swapping the meaning of $i$ and $j$ but you know that's because in a symmetric matrix rows and columns are a bit similar. The upper half of column $$ is the left half of row $j$ after all.], I then find a starting node `node` (which is a non-zero in $A_{1:(i-1),i}$) and I walk along that node checking each time if I've actually seen that node^[If `mark[node]==j` then I have already found `node` and all of its ancestors in my sweep of row `j`] before. If I haven't seen it before, I added one to the column count of column `node`^[This is because `L[j,node] != 0` by our logic.]. \n\nTo allocate the non-zero structure, I just need to replace that counter increment with an assignment.\n\n### Attempt 1: Lord that's slow\n\nWe will do the pure python version first.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef symbolic_cholesky_base(A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count):\n  n = len(A_indptr) - 1\n  col_ptr = np.repeat(1, n+1)\n  col_ptr[1:] += np.cumsum(col_count) \n  L_indices = np.zeros(sum(col_count), dtype=int)\n  L_indptr = np.zeros(n+1, dtype=int)\n  L_indptr[1:] = np.cumsum(col_count)\n  mark = [-1] * n\n\n  for i in range(n):\n    mark[i] = i\n    L_indices[L_indptr[i]] = i\n\n    for indptr in range(A_indptr[i], A_indptr[i+1]):\n      node = A_indices[indptr]\n      while node < i and mark[node] != i:\n        mark[node] = i\n        L_indices[col_ptr[node]] = i\n        col_ptr[node] += 1\n        node = parent[node]\n  \n  return (L_indices, L_indptr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nDoes it work?\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nA_indices, A_indptr, A_x, A = make_matrix(13)\nparent, col_count = etree_base(A.indices, A.indptr)\n\nL_indices, L_indptr = symbolic_cholesky_base(A.indices, A.indptr, parent, col_count)\nL_indices_true, L_indptr_true = _symbolic_factor(A_indices, A_indptr)\n\nprint(all(x==y for (x,y) in zip(L_indices, L_indices_true)))\nprint(all(x==y for (x,y) in zip(L_indptr, L_indptr_true)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFabulosa!\n\nNow let's do the compiled version.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom functools import partial\n@partial(jit, static_argnums = (4,))\ndef symbolic_cholesky(A_indices, A_indptr, L_indptr, parent, nnz):\n  \n  ## innermost while loop\n  def body_while(val):\n    i, L_indices, L_indptr, node, parent, col_ptr, mark = val\n    mark = mark.at[node].set(i)\n    #p = \n    L_indices = L_indices.at[col_ptr[node]].set(i)\n    col_ptr = col_ptr.at[node].add(1)\n    return (i, L_indices, L_indptr, parent[node], parent, col_ptr, mark)\n\n  def cond_while(val):\n    i, L_indices, L_indptr, node, parent, col_ptr, mark = val\n    return lax.bitwise_and(lax.lt(node, i), lax.ne(mark[node], i))\n\n  ## Inner for loop\n  def body_inner_for(indptr, val):\n    i, A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark = val\n    node = A_indices[indptr]\n    i, L_indices, L_indptr, node, parent, col_ptr, mark = lax.while_loop(cond_while, body_while, (i, L_indices, L_indptr, node, parent, col_ptr, mark))\n    return (i, A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark)\n  \n  ## Outer for loop\n  def body_out_for(i, val):\n     A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark = val\n     mark = mark.at[i].set(i)\n     L_indices = L_indices.at[L_indptr[i]].set(i)\n     i, A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark = lax.fori_loop(A_indptr[i], A_indptr[i+1], body_inner_for, (i, A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark))\n     return (A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark)\n\n  ## Body of code\n  n = len(A_indptr) - 1\n  col_ptr = L_indptr + 1\n  L_indices = jnp.zeros(nnz, dtype=int)\n  \n  mark = jnp.repeat(-1, n)\n  \n  init = (A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark)\n  A_indices, A_indptr, L_indices, L_indptr, parent, col_ptr, mark = lax.fori_loop(0, n, body_out_for, init)\n  return L_indices\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's check it works\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=26}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nA_indices, A_indptr, A_x, A = make_matrix(20)\nparent, col_count = etree(A.indices, A.indptr)\nL_indptr = np.zeros(A.shape[0]+1, dtype=int)\nL_indptr[1:] = np.cumsum(col_count)\n\n\nL_indices = symbolic_cholesky(A.indices, A.indptr, L_indptr, parent, nnz = L_indptr[-1])\nL_indices_true, L_indptr_true = _symbolic_factor(A_indices, A_indptr)\nprint(all(L_indices == L_indices_true))\nprint(all(L_indptr == L_indptr_true))\n\nA_indices, A_indptr, A_x, A = make_matrix(31)\n\nparent, col_count = etree(A.indices, A.indptr)\nL_indptr = np.zeros(A.shape[0]+1, dtype=int)\nL_indptr[1:] = np.cumsum(col_count)\n\n\nL_indices = symbolic_cholesky(A.indices, A.indptr, L_indptr, parent, nnz = L_indptr[-1])\nL_indices_true, L_indptr_true = _symbolic_factor(A_indices, A_indptr)\n\nprint(all(L_indices == L_indices_true))\nprint(all(L_indptr == L_indptr_true))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\nTrue\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSuccess!\n\nOne _minor_ problem.

I want to pretend that I've got elegant ideas about this. But I don't. So let's just do it. The most obvious thing to do is to use the algorithm to get the non-zero structure of the _rows_ of $L$. These are the things that are being indexed by `col_ptr[node]]`, so if we have these explicitly we don't need multiple indirection. We also don't need a while loop.\n\nIn fact, if we have the non-zero structure of the rows of $L$, we can turn that into the non-zero structure of the columns in linear-ish^[Convert from CSR to `(i, j, val)` (called COO, which has a convenient implementation in `jax.experimental.sparse`) to CSC. This involves a linear pass, a sort, and another linear pass. So it's $n \\log n`ish. Hire me fancy tech companies. I can count. Just don't ask me to program quicksort.] time.\n\nAll we need to do is make sure that our `etree()` function is also counting the number of nonzeros in each row.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=32}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n@jit\ndef etree(A_indices, A_indptr):\n # print(\"(Re-)compiling etree(A_indices, A_indptr)\")\n  ## innermost while loop\n  def body_while(val):\n  #  print(val)\n    j, node, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = val\n    update_parent = lambda x: x[0].at[x[1]].set(x[2])\n    parent = lax.cond(lax.eq(parent[node], -1), update_parent, lambda x: x[0], (parent, node, j))\n    mark = mark.at[node].set(j)\n    col_count = col_count.at[node].add(1)\n    row_count = row_count.at[j].add(1)\n    return (j, parent[node], parent, col_count, row_count, mark)\n\n  def cond_while(val):\n    j, node, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = val\n    return lax.bitwise_and(lax.lt(node, j), lax.ne(mark[node], j))\n\n  ## Inner for loop\n  def body_inner_for(indptr, val):\n    j, A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = val\n    node = A_indices[indptr]\n    j, node, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = lax.while_loop(cond_while, body_while, (j, node, parent, col_count, row_count, mark))\n    return (j, A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark)\n  \n  ## Outer for loop\n  def body_out_for(j, val):\n     A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = val\n     mark = mark.at[j].set(j)\n     j, A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = lax.fori_loop(A_indptr[j], A_indptr[j+1], body_inner_for, (j, A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark))\n     return (A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark)\n\n  ## Body of code\n  n = len(A_indptr) - 1\n  parent = jnp.repeat(-1, n)\n  mark = jnp.repeat(-1, n)\n  col_count = jnp.repeat(1,  n)\n  row_count = jnp.repeat(1, n)\n  init = (A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark)\n  A_indices, A_indptr, parent, col_count, row_count, mark = lax.fori_loop(0, n, body_out_for, init)\n  return (parent, col_count, row_count)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's check that the code is actually doing what I want.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=33}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nA_indices, A_indptr, A_x, A = make_matrix(57)\nparent, col_count, row_count = etree(A.indices, A.indptr)\nL_indices, L_indptr = _symbolic_factor(A_indices, A_indptr)\n\ntrue_parent = L_indices[L_indptr[:-2] + 1]\ntrue_parent[np.where(np.diff(L_indptr[:-1]) == 1)] = -1\nprint(all(x == y for (x,y) in zip(parent[:-1], true_parent)))\n\ntrue_col_count  = np.diff(L_indptr)\nprint(all(true_col_count == col_count))\n\ntrue_row_count = np.array([len(np.where(L_indices == i)[0]) for i in range(57**2)])\nprint(all(true_row_count == row_count))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\nTrue\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExcellent! With this we can modify our previous function to give us the row-indices of the non-zero pattern instead. Just for further chaos, please note that we are using a CSC representation of $A$ to get a CSR representation of $L$. \n\nOnce again, we will prototype in pure python and then translate to JAX. The thing to look out for this time is that we _know_ how many non-zeros there are in a row and we know where we need to put them. This suggests that we can compute these things in `body_inner_for` and then do a vectorised version of our indirect indexing. This should compile down to a single [XLA `scatter` call](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics#scatter). This will reduce the number of overall `scatter` calls from $\\operatorname(nnz)(L)$ to $n$.

I was, in an act of hubris, trying very hard to not end up here. But that was tragically slow. So here we are.\n\nHe came up with two methods.\n\n1. Pad out `row_ind` so it's always long enough. This only costs memory. The maximum size of `row_ind` is `n`. Unfortunately, this happens whenever $A$ has a dense row. Sadly, for Bayesian^[This also happens with the profile likelihood in non-Bayesian methods.] linear mixed models this will happen if we put Gaussian priors on the covariate coefficients^[the $\\beta$s] and we try to marginalise them out with the other multivariate Gaussian parts. It is possible to write the routines that deal with dense rows and columns explicitly, but it's a pain in the arse.\n\n1.
